# tacticalurbanismguide.com

This site was designed to promote the Tactical Urbanism Guide publications on [issuu](http://issuu.com/).
It was developed as a one-page static site, without a backend database. It uses leaflet.js to display the map, and [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) + [Mapsheet.js](https://github.com/jsoma/mapsheet) to display the map connected to google sheets. However, the Google Sheets connection is not configured. The site was launched on 16-10-2014. The map of urban tactics is an aggregated feed of `.KML` files related to tactical urbanism published on Google Maps.
