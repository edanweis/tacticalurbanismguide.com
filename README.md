# tacticalurbanismguide.com

This site was designed to promote the Tactical Urbanism Guide publications on [issuu](http://issuu.com/).
It was developed as a one-page static site, without a database. It uses [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com) to display the map, and [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) + [Mapsheet.js](https://github.com/jsoma/mapsheet) to connect it to Google Sheets. At present, the Google Sheets connection is not configured. The site was launched on 16-10-2014. The map of urban tactics was intended to show an aggregated feed of `.KML` files related to tactical urbanism, Eg: [PARK(ing) Day](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=z4HZvezfb_WQ.kF2bpP2-3LPA) available on Google Maps.
